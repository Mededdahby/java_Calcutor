# Calculator Project with Java Swing and Sockets

## Overview

This project implements a basic calculator with a graphical user interface using Java Swing. The calculator performs calculations on the server side by establishing a socket connection between the client and server.

## Features

- **Graphical User Interface:** The calculator provides a simple and intuitive GUI for users to input mathematical expressions. üñ©

- **Socket Communication:** The calculator uses socket communication to send mathematical expressions from the client to the server for calculation. üì°

- **Server-side Calculation:** The server performs the actual calculation based on the received expression and sends back the result to the client. üñ•Ô∏è

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on both client and server machines. ‚òï

## Usage

1. **Compile the Server and Client:**

   ```bash
   javac Server.java
   javac Client.java
   ```

2. **Run the Server:**

   ```bash
   java Server
   ```

3. **Run the Client:**

   ```bash
   java Client
   ```

4. **Use the Calculator:**
   - Enter mathematical expressions in the GUI on the client side.
   - Press the "Calculate" button to send the expression to the server.
   - The server will process the expression and send back the result.
   - The result will be displayed on the client interface.
